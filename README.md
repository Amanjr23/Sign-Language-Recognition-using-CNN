This project focuses on recognizing hand signs for alphabets and numbers using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to reduce the communication gap between the deaf and non-signers by providing an accurate sign-to-text recognition system.

The model was trained on a dataset of 7200 images, and it achieved an accuracy of 98%, showing strong capability in gesture classification.
